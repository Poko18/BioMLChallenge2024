# BioML Challenge 2024 - Protein binders for hCD20 üß¨

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the **BioML Challenge 2024: Bits to Binders** competition, organized by the University of Texas at Austin BioML Society. The aim of this competition is to advance protein design using modern AI tools. Our task is to design a protein sequence that effectively binds to a specific cancer antigen target, with the goal of activating CAR-T cell proliferation and killing responses.
